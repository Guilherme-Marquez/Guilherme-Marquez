## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Cognitive Science at Central European University. My research focuses on cultural evolution, social cognition, evolutionary game theory, and the psychology of social power.

Iâ€™m also interested in coding, exploring new technologies, and occasionally creating art and music.
